The holiday season is a time that is cherished by many. The time between Thanksgiving and until we ring in the New Year is a blur of food, family, and flustration. Yes, flustration, a combination of flustered and frustrated. As I've gotten older and the general family situation has gotten progressively more complicated, it certainly ups the complexity of what at one point (felt like) pretty straightforward gathering.

1. Find a date/time that works for the family
2. Commit to being at that place at that time

Oh, but wait. Now there's in-laws on both side of the family that have their own family things. Family members are coming down with stuff and don't want to spread illness. I mean, fair, but inconvenient.

Also, being married to someone that is a much better event planner than I am, it's also not as easy as all that. In addition to finding a time that works for 6 different families with their own other holiday plans they are having to sort out, you need to answer...

1. Who has the space and desire (or at least willingness) to host a group of 15+ people?
2. Where are out of town family members going to stay?
3. What's the itinerary?
4. What activities should be planned/accounted for?
5. What are we going to eat? Who's going to cook it, buy it, or bring it?

### What's the Point?

Were I to go back to high-school or college Nathan and talk to him about such things (in disguise, of course), I'd probably get a blank stare or an eye roll. Ah, the ignorance of youth.

You see, growing up I was going one of two places every year for Christmas to visit one side of my family or the other respectively. Rural Alabama for my mother's side or the panhandle of Florida for my father's. Our Christmas celebrations were almost exclusively at these other households. It was predictable. We did the exact same thing at each respective location, only it happened every other year. I grew up feeling that it was normal to only see one side of the family or the other during the holidays and not having to do anything to benefit from the goings-on of the holiday.

Then I got married to someone that grew up visiting one side of her family for Christmas lunch and the other for dinner. What I've learned in the last seven years is that perspective is everything. We shape our environment and our environment shapes us. So knowing this, we must be intentional about shaping our environment since we know that our environment shapes us (and our kids, if we have any).

I don't know how much about the "Behind the scenes" of these family gatherings I went to as a kid. I should probably ask. I mostly remember just watching a bunch of TV, drinking a lot of Dr. Thunder, and hanging out with my cousins. Reading the book "The Secrets of Happy Families" this past year really made me want to double down on crafting family gatherings with intention so that they are memorable and have the effect of building relationships in the way that we just don't get around to.

## Holiday Season 2022

Here were the "best laid plans" that we had for this holiday season.

1. December 18th-23rd - Christmas Break Trip to Disney World
2. December 24th - Clean house for hosting Nicholson Christmas
3. December 25th - Christmas Morning and small-family Christmas
4. December 26th - Big Nicholson Christmas
5. December 28th - Razorback Bowl Game w/Fam
6. January 1st - New Years and Schluterman Family Christmas

And here's how things actually shook out...

1. December 18th-24th - Christmas Break Trip to Disney World
   1. Plane touched down at 2am vs original 9pm the day before.
   2. Schluterman Family Christmas resheduled for the 27th
2. December 24th - Clean house for hosting Nicholson Family Christmas
   1. Learn my mother is feeling unwell and punt Nicholson Family Christmas
   2. Learn my brother and family are feeling unwell
   3. Learn my grandfather was going to the hospital after being unresponsive
3. December 25th - Christmas Morning and small-family Christmas
   1. Find out grandfather back at home
4. December 26th-28th - Schluterman Christmas Gathering and Razorback Bowl Game
   1. Bring all of the food we had bought for 15+ person family gathering that wouldn't be good after a week.
   2. This was, of course, in combination with the food for the 20+ person family gathering that was already there.
   3. Woo Pig! We almost blew it (but not as much as that targeting call that was retroactively reversed)
5. January ??? - Nicholson Family Christmas at some point I guess?

## In Conclusion

The holidays aren't quite over yet. At least, not for my side of the family. I relish the time I get to spend with my family, but always come out of New Years craving a period of stability and routine after over a month of throwing our previous routine out the window. Of course, it's just in time for the beginning provided by the New Year to reassess and revise our plans and routines to ensure they are working for us and not vice-versa.

This is Nathan, signing off. I hope you had a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
