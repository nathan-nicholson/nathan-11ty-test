I've had this notion to develop a journaling habit for a while. Years really. The idea of it is just so romantic. The thoughts of the reflective soul pouring onto the pages of their journal, discovering insights about themselves, noting things of interest for further study & exploration, or just making sense of the world. Years later, the soul's progeny discover the journals of their sire and have a window into his head. I believe that notion, or at least the conclusions or ideas that I draw from it, are exactly the thing that keep me from getting started.

I think I'm generally so worried about writing something of value that I don't write anything at all. I muse and I think and I reflect, wringing my hands and gnashing my teeth in the hopes that I can write something worth reading. I intellectually understand that any skill, such as writing, must be developed in the crucible of exertion and failure. You need to put in the reps and iteratively refine. But you can't refine if you don't suck first.

So, here's the plan. I'm going to start intentionally practicing my writing knowing that it's going to stink. I'm going to write about things that are interesting to me. I'm going to explore classical methods of developing this skill and I'm going to work it.

What will this look like?

1. At least once a week, I will post something. Regardless of it's done-ness. It will get posted.
2. On these weekly posts, I will spend no longer than 1 hour to write them.
3. In parallel, I will work on one longer post at a time. Limit my WIP, you know.
4. These posts will be at least 1000 words long.

Also this site is a Work in Progress. It'll get better over time. But it's for me, not for anyone else, so meh.
